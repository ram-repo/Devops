# DevOps Interview Questions

## Jenkins

1. How would you configure a Jenkins pipeline to deploy to multiple environments (e.g., dev, staging, production) while ensuring that the deployment to the next environment only occurs if the previous environment's deployment was successful?
2. How can you implement and manage Jenkins shared libraries to reuse code across multiple Jenkins pipelines?
3. How would you set up Jenkins to scale horizontally to handle increased load from numerous concurrent builds?

## Terraform

1. How do you manage state in Terraform, and what strategies can you use to prevent state file conflicts in a team environment?
2. Explain how you can use Terraform modules to promote code reuse and maintainability in large infrastructure deployments.
3. How would you implement a CI/CD pipeline for Terraform to ensure automated and reliable infrastructure provisioning?

## Docker

1. How would you optimize Docker image build times and reduce image sizes?
2. Describe the process of setting up a secure private Docker registry and configuring authentication for it.
3. How can you troubleshoot a Docker container that is not starting or behaving unexpectedly?

## Kubernetes (K8s)

1. How would you design a high-availability Kubernetes cluster across multiple regions?
2. Explain the process of configuring Kubernetes RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to enforce least privilege access.
3. How would you implement and manage secrets in Kubernetes to ensure the security of sensitive data?

## Ansible

1. How would you design an Ansible playbook to ensure idempotency and handle configuration drift?
2. Explain how you would manage different environments (e.g., dev, staging, production) in Ansible.
3. How can you use Ansible Vault to securely manage sensitive information in your playbooks?
